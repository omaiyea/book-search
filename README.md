# Book Search 
Book Search lets you search for books (both e-books and print books). After you find what you're looking for, you can then navigate to Google Books where you can purchase the book or read more information. 

## Motivation
This was built as a simple app to start practicing React.

## Built With
React, JSX, CSS

## Future Enhancements
* Need to handle API key so that a live demo can happen without exposing it
* Error handling
